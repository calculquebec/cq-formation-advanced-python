title: Advanced and Parallel Python
subtitle: Performance
---
You've probably heard by now that Python is an easy to use, multi-purpose language but that it's slow. While this might be true implementing algorithms naively, it's performance can often be very good, and even on par with a C implementation.

The goal of this workshop is to give you the ability to take existing Python code and make it go faster. Way faster.
